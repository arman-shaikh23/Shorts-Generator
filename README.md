# Real Estate AI Shorts Generator (Premium SaaS)

An enterprise-grade, Canva-tier AI platform that empowers Real Estate Agents, Builders, and Marketing Agencies to effortlessly transform raw property footage into high-converting, viral social media shorts. The product bridges the gap between raw assets and published marketing material by replacing tedious manual video editing with intelligent, context-aware AI storytelling and an interactive visual timeline.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), Motor (Async MongoDB)
- **Database**: MongoDB (Atlas)
- **Auth**: RSA-256 JWT with Refresh Token Rotation
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini Pro (via Files API)
- **Render Engine**: FFmpeg

## Features
- **Interactive Story Builder**: The AI detects room types (Exterior, Living Room, Kitchen) and proposes a logical walkthrough sequence. Users can drag-and-drop these timeline blocks to perfect the story before rendering.
- **3 Reel Variations**: Instead of a single output, the AI automatically generates 3 unique stylistic variations (Luxury, Viral, Realtor) allowing the user to select the perfect vibe.
- **Premium Workspace Dashboard**: A Notion-inspired workspace to manage Projects, view Uploads, access Generation History, and track Analytics.
- **Advanced Upload Hub**: Seamlessly import 10-40 videos via dynamic URL cards, Dropbox Folder links, or a massive drag-and-drop local file zone.
- **Enterprise Reliability & Auth**: Secure RSA-256 Google & Email login, backed by intelligent exponential backoff and model failover (`gemini-2.5-pro` -> `flash`) to ensure 99.9% processing uptime.
- Direct downloads of fully prepared `.mp4` clips.

## Troubleshooting
- **Professional Camera Footage (Sony XAVC, etc.)**: High-end footage with `rtmd` metadata streams or 10-bit 4:2:2 chroma subsampling might fail standard FFmpeg extraction. The application automatically normalizes this footage, dropping non-video/audio streams and forcing `yuv420p` pixel format to ensure Gemini AI compatibility.
- **API 404 Errors**: If `/api/process` returns a 404 on deployment, verify that the static file mount isn't intercepting the root path. Our production build is configured to serve static assets safely without shadowing `/api/*`.
- **Windows Python 3.13 `NotImplementedError`**: FFmpeg commands are deliberately executed using `subprocess.run` inside `asyncio.to_thread()` instead of `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`. This is to circumvent a `NotImplementedError` limitation on Windows platforms with the Proactor event loop. 
- **Missing Videos**: If downloading from Dropbox fails or creates empty files, check the server logs. We have added deep debugging around the download stage to trace HTTP responses, content types, and file sizes.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- `ffmpeg` installed on your system (`sudo apt install ffmpeg` / `brew install ffmpeg` / download for Windows)
- A Gemini API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### 1. Clone & Setup Backend
```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# (Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate)

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and add your GEMINI_API_KEY
```

### 2. Setup Frontend
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 3. Run Locally (Development)

Start the backend:
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Access the app at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment to Railway
1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Log into [Railway](https://railway.app/).
3. Create a new project -> Deploy from GitHub repo.
4. Railway will automatically detect the `Dockerfile` and build both the frontend and backend into a single deployable unit.
5. In your Railway project variables, add:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: `<your_api_key>`
6. Deploy and access via the generated public URL!
